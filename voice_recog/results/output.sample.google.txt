 It's kind of feel like giving an update right now. So.
 Talk about where I am.
 I've been having a conversation with nikhil at work and it mainly involved how
 AirWatch suck.
 And working with deep sucked and do what we're doing sucked.
 and
 I guess the conversation we had and I guess he had with other people became a
 substance and the substance was him leaving. He leaves Friday the 13th of June.
 And so someone I consider a good friend and someone that's been good to work
 with is going to be leaving and kind of feel like happy for nikhil because it's
  like yeah.
